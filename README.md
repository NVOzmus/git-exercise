# git-exercise
Hello, welcome to my README. It's been about a year since I had to deal with markdown language. I am very rusty. I hope to capture some of the magic I was part of in my creative endeavors at the beginning of the year.

First change: made a Readme branch

Second change: Made a develop branch, added new files (index.html, style.css, application.js)
